# dotfiles

There are many repos like it but this one is mine!

## Author: [nefari0uss](https://www.github.com/nefari0uss)

## Dotfiles Website: [github.io](https://nefari0uss.github.io/dotfiles)

## Installation
An install script is currently being worked on. Otherwise, assume that most config files go in either the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` location or under their default location (usually `$HOME` or `$HOME/.config`).

## Dependencies
There's lots of little dependencies here and there. OS specific install scripts should grab dependencies as needed.

I'm currently undergoing a process to make the repo much more lean and mean.

Assume that at at minimum, you'll need the following:
- Bash/Zsh
- Git
- SSH
- GPG
- Vim/NeoVim

Windows:
- Chocolatey
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

macOS:
- Homebrew

Arch Linux:
- AUR

## Note/Disclaimer
- Do not blindly copy or install this config without understanding what each file/line is for.
- The config was made for me and me only.
- I strongly suggest learning what each line does and adapting it for your own purposes if you feel it is useful to you.
