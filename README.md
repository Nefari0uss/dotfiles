# dotfiles

There are many repos like it but this one is mine!

## Author: [nefari0uss](https://www.github.com/nefari0uss)

## Dotfiles Website: [github.io](https://nefari0uss.github.io/dotfiles)

## Installation

An install script is currently being worked on. Otherwise, assume that most config files go in either the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` location or under their default location (usually `$HOME` or `$HOME/.config`).

## Dependencies

There's lots of little dependencies here and there. OS specific install scripts should grab dependencies as needed.

I'm currently undergoing a process to make the repo much more lean and mean.

Assume that at minimum, you'll need the following:

- Bash/Zsh
- SSH
- GPG
- Vim/NeoVim

- [Git](https://git-scm.com)
- [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta)
- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
- [Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa)
- [Keychain](https://github.com/funtoo/keychain)

Windows:

- Chocolatey
- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

macOS:

- Homebrew

Arch Linux:

- AUR
