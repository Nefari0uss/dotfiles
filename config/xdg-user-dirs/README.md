# xdg-user-dirs

This folder contains the XDG user directories config. This is to prevent duplicate folders like `Downloads` and `downloads` from appearing on my machine as I prefer to have everything in lower case.

## user-dirs.dirs
Specifies the default directories for:
* desktop
* documents
* downloads
* music
* pictures
* public 
* templates
* videos

## user-dirs.locale
Specifies the user locale. Mine is set to US English.
