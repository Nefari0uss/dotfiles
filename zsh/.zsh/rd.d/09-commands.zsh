# Commands, funtions and aliases

# Always set aliases _last,_ so they don't get used in function definitions.

# This lets you change to any dir without having to type `cd`, that is, by just
# typing its name. Be warned, though: This can misfire if there exists an alias,
# function, builtin or command with the same name.
# In general, I would recommend you use only the following without `cd`:
#   ..  to go one dir up
#   ~   to go to your home dir
#   ~-2 to go to the 2nd mostly recently visited dir
#   /   to go to the root dir
setopt AUTO_CD

# Type '-' to return to your previous dir.
alias -- -='cd -'
# '--' signifies the end of options. Otherwise, '-=...' would be interpreted as
# a flag.

# These aliases enable us to paste example code into the terminal without the
# shell complaining about the pasted prompt symbol.

# zmv lets you batch rename (or copy or link) files by using pattern matching.

# of your aliases. It will figure them out automatically.
